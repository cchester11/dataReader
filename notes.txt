// Create a home page (done)
// - home page has a description about the project 
// - below the description is a pressable button used to generate a set of numbers using the writeJSON.js file
// - send the user to index.html after the button is pressed

// Generate new Data 
// - import writeJSON.js file into generateData.js file (check)
// - generateData.js will consist of a chain of functions
// -  1. writeJSON file will execute at addEventListener for generateData button
// -  2. dom.js functions will run to populate index.html with new set of numbers

// add new set to the data map that keeps track of the total number of numbers in the data set
// - at the end of writeJSON.js create a loop to go through the length of the map
// - write a new object to map with a key of total and a value of the length of the map
// - display total as a div at the top of the screen

// allow changes to data on the front end
// - user can manipulate the text on the UI
// - after user manipulates a field in the UI, a post request is sent to the database and the corresponding object takes on those changes
