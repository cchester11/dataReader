// - below the description is a pressable button used to generate a set of numbers using the writeJSON.js file
// - send the user to index.html after the button is pressed

// Generate new Data 
// click generate data btn to run the writeJSON script
// fetch the new data and reload index page

// add new set to the data map that keeps track of the total number of numbers in the data set
// - at the end of writeJSON.js create a loop to go through the length of the map
// - write a new object to map with a key of total and a value of the length of the map
// - display total as a div at the top of the screen

// allow changes to data on the front end
// - user can manipulate the text on the UI
// - after user manipulates a field in the UI, a post request is sent to the database and the corresponding object takes on those changes

// allow for different ways of sorting and building the json file 
// - have multiple button options for building the index.html file out with data
